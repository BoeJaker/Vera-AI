✔ Intent-first planning (no tools in initial LLM context) (fast)
✔ Deterministic Planning
✔ Lazy tool loading & binding
✔ Tool domains
✔ Typed IR (Intermediate Relationships) (Container, Repo, Service)
✔ Multi-host execution (local / SSH / Docker / Proxmox stub)
✔ Capability negotiation per host
✔ Intent cost modeling
✔ Learned intent → tool ranking
✔ Workflow resolution caching
✔ Variable extraction & propagation
✔ Automatic variable suggestion
✔ Backtracking on failure
✔ Parallel branch exploration
✔ Multi-objective scoring (cost, risk, latency, resources)
✔ Approval gates (intent + tool level)
✔ Replay protection / idempotency
✔ Dynamic tool discovery support
✔ Clean mapping to Docker / Git / Services
✔ Fallback to full tool executor if binding fails
