i have this chat ui its almost perfect, but when json renders i want it to automatically display in tree mode rather than raw and when mermaid diagrams are written i want them to be automatically rendered in the chat bubble with the ability to switch back and forth. please dont loose any existing features or style. i.e. the focus in canvas or any other existing feature. the text is streamed into the chat bubbles token by token. Also all the messages say "just now" it never changes to the actual time they were posted. i would like some extra buttons on the control bar one that opens a sidebar for chat settings(to be later implemented), another for a chat history sidebar(also yet to be implemented), id like a chat search on the right of the control panel. system mesages have an edge highlight on hover but i don't want them to. on formatted code in chat bubbles the send to canvas button is not working
