Tools

Insert Step - allow the toolchain to defer writing a step in-full i.e. it needs to eval bash output first

Relational 
## Demonstration

Video of terminal prompts in-action / OBS

Web UI &API using sockets with STT/TTS

Cloudflared endpint for demos

## Orchestration

Sandboxing & CI/CD w/ github

Proxmox Control

## Compute

Containerised services like TTS, STT etc

Containerised tool sets like Kali etc

Distributed compute integration:
Celery, Ray, Spark, Dask, javascript browser compute
Allow the LLM to queue tasks for distributed compute and load balance between available compute resource

## Memory

Short circuits

Tiered parallel memory storage and recollection

Link Graph to corpus located in chroma, dont include in the graph itself.
Neo4j = Metadata, Chroma = Text, Blockstore = Raw Data
look at replacing chroma for weaviate
Node Vector graph visualisations of memory, toolchains and plans

See different relationship spaces by filtering by relationship or see entire trees of relationships with no filters

dimensions of time, semantic relevance and connectedness

Use pydantic to define memory types
